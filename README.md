# Runway Example laravel App

This is an example app demonstrating how to deploy a laravel app
to [runway](https://www.runway.horse/).

* clone this repo, and navigate into that directory
* `runway app create`
* `runway app deploy`
* `runway open`

You can then deploy changes by `git commit`ing them, and running `runway app
deploy` again.

This is the Laravel demo application (`9.x`), created with `composer create-project laravel/laravel laravel-app`.
